    "This demo shows how using RAG context with the CSA v4.0 security guide for cloud computing will provide more relevant responses compared to using a LLM directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution will demostrate using a vector database with RAG to reduce hallucination and provided context to prompts for better results. First we will call the LLM with no prompt engineering or RAG to see results are generic and not what we are looking for. Next we will add a prompt template using Langchain to improve our prompt. Then we will first lookup results in a vector database to provde better context with our prompt before calling the LLM. Results will now be related to our intended topic. Finally, we will string prompts together as a chat history to provide even more context to our prompts using previous questions."
